Pros
	It’s fully declarative, you only use React Components and Props. There’s no magic.
	If the component that use the render props needs to re-render, it only re-renders what’s defined in render function.
Cons
	Let’s say you need to access the data from componentWillReceiveProps or another lifecycle callback different from render. You can’t, because it’s attached to the render function scope.
Perfect Use Case
	Use it to define Components wrapping recursive or iterative logic. I found it really useful in those cases. The RequestAnimationFrame component is an ideal example of that.
	Use it to define Components following the Container/Presentational Component pattern.
	Use it to define Components that access the React Context API.

Variants:
	Function as Child -> render function is passed in as a child instead of as a prop
